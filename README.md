## Introduction

This repository contains various programs implemented in C, aimed at understanding and applying advanced algorithmic techniques such as sorting, stack manipulation, queue handling, and greedy methods. The repository includes visual outputs for performance evaluation of sorting algorithms.

## Program Structure

### Lab 1

- **946. Validate Stack Sequences** (`946. Validate Stack Sequences.c`): Implements stack simulation to validate whether a given pop sequence is valid for a given push sequence.
- **1944. Number of Visible People in a Queue** (`1944. Number of Visible People in a Queue.c`): Solves a queue-based problem using a monotonic stack to determine visibility counts efficiently.

### Lab 2

- **700. Number of Students Unable to Eat Lunch** (`700. Number of Students Unable to Eat Lunch.c`): Implements queue simulation to find how many students cannot eat lunch based on preference matching.
- **Selection Sort Implementation**:
  - `SelectionSort.c`: Core implementation of the selection sort algorithm. This program provides options for manual entry of array elements and displays the time taken to sort arrays of different sizes. The selection sort algorithm works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning.
  - `SelectionSort.exe`: Executable for Windows users to run the program directly.
  - `SelectionSortGraph.pdf`: Performance graph showing time taken for various input sizes.
  - `SelectionSortOutput.png`: Sample output screenshot of the program execution.

### LeetCode Practice

- **155. Min Stack** (`155_MINSTACK.c`): Implementation of a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
